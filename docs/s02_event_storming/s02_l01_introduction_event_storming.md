# Event storming introduction

Before diving into the techniques that will help you **design and implement** your desired architecture,
in this section we will focus on a technique that comes **before** designing or implementation.

The technique we will focus on is called **event storming**.

In order to understand what problem event storming is addressing and what value it can ultimately add to your  
architecture, let's look at this quote from the creator of event storming.

> "_...it is not the domain expert’s knowledge that goes into production, it is the developer’s assumption of that
> knowledge that goes into production..._"  
> **Alberto Brandolini** (Inventor of Event Storming)

This statement describes the gap that stands between the domain expert's idea and the final product.  
The larger this gap is, the higher the chance is that software being built will not respond to the right user needs.  
Event storming is a collaborative technique that helps domain experts and engineers reduce and bridge this gap
**together**.

In this section, we'll explore the principles, techniques, and practical applications of event storming.  
We'll cover various aspects, including:

* format of the event storming sessions,
* key concepts that are being uncovered through event storming such as actors, commands and events,
* other modeling concepts such as business processes, aggregates and external systems and
* and finally, we will cover tips that can help you facilitate event storming yourself.

Event storming is a powerful tool for exploring and understanding the domain model.
So let's dive deeper into the format of this technique.
