# Event storming format

Event storming is a **lightweight**, **workshop** format.  
It is being used for **collaborative** exploration of **business domains**.  
Event storming result is expressed in **sticky notes** on a wide wall or a modeling space.

## Event storming goals

Let's take a look at what are the goals of event storming sessions.

* As a software engineer you are (almost) always operating within a certain business domain.  
**Each** business domain has key concepts such as **actors**, **events**, **business processes** and others.
Goal of the event storming session is to **uncover** these (and several other) key concepts.
* Another important goal is also to make sure **all participants** of the workshop share the **same mental model** of
  these concepts by the end of the workshop.
* Finally, brainstorming on the business space will inevitably uncover some problems as well.
  * For example differences and conflicts in understanding of the business processes between the stakeholders. This is good, as
  it brings an opportunity to flush out all the different perspectives and views.
  * Also mapping out the business process can often uncover clear bottlenecks and problems in the business process
  itself.

## Event storming participants

Now let's go through some of the most important participants of the event storming sessions.

As previously mentioned, event storming consists of a series of **workshops**.  
These workshops can be facilitated **in person** or **remotely**.

Participants of the workshops are **all the stakeholders** for a given business domain.  
There are roughly two types of stakeholders - **people with questions** and **people with answers**.
There are no strict rules on this though.  
These two sets often overlap, as people have both questions and answers.

* Stakeholders with questions are most often engineers that will develop the software and the designers that will design
its UX.
* And stakeholders with answers are most often product owners or managers (sometimes even customers). 

Even though we will be using this technique to establish a good shared understanding
of the system we need to implement as software engineers, event storming workshops **should not be**
limited to only engineers.  
**In fact**, it is highly **encouraged** to involve at least few domain experts in each workshop.  
Otherwise, session will end up with a lot of unanswered questions.

Similarly, having just domain experts in a session might not be very engaging and productive as
not many people will be there to ask questions.

Remember - 2nd goal of the event storming is gaining **shared understanding**.  
This goal can not be achieved if either one of the participant types is missing.  
Have this in mind when facilitating event storming session.

## Event storming outcomes

During the session, participants will be **adding stickies** of different colours on the modeling space.  
There are **two** expected results that should come out of the event storming sessions.

* First one is the **business process** that can be seen on the modeling space. At the end of the sessions you will get
a space full of stickies that represent your business process.  
Modeling space might contain notes, additional questions and red flags indications.  
Also, you might start to recognise patterns and clusters of related concepts.
* The second outcome, and perhaps more important one, is the **knowledge**, that was built in the minds of the
participants.

This means that the actual artefact that comes out of the session - a pile of coloured stickies,
is **less important** than the actual knowledge that was shared between the participants.

There are a lot of stakeholders with different perspectives and knowledge about the business domain.  
Goal of the event storming is to **flush out and surface** all that knowledge and make it **shared**
between all the participants.

## DDD implications

Event storming was invented in the context of the **Domain Driven Design**.  
However, this course will **not** go into the details of DDD.  
There are many great resources that can give you introduction and deep knowledge of this topic.  
I highly recommend following books to start with:

* "Domain Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Hearth of Software" by Eric Evans.
    * In this book, often referred to as "**the blue book**", Eric Evans introduced the concept and first coined the
      term DDD.
* Another great book is "Domain Driven Design Distilled" by Vaughn Vernon.
    * This is a great summary of the "blue book". It is **concise, readable, and actionable**. It will not bury you in
      detail and will give you exactly what you need to get **results**.

Also, there are many great courses on DDD out there as well.
