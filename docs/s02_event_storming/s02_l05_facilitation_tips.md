# Facilitation tips

Now that we have covered all event storming concepts and did our first event storming session
let's go through ten tips that will help you facilitate your event storming sessions.

1. Have the right stakeholders in the room. This is the most important piece of advice that can make
your event storming better. Without the right people your event storming might not provide much value.
2. Plan the session and be clear about goals and non-goals. Most probably you will have several sessions
and not just one. Be clear about the goal of each session - for example by saying "In this session we
will be covering only actors and commands.".
3. Send instructions upfront. As you already see, there is some context about this technique. Make sure
that participants can read about what event storming is and what are different types of stickies.
4. Provide an example. Although for some participants instructions will work well, for others a concrete
example of a full event storming result can work even better. Make sure to provide this.
5. Keep insisting on non-technical language. You will have both technical and non-technical people
in the room. It is your job to keep the tone non-technical so that everyone can follow. Be aware of
this as engineers will tend to go into the details of implementation.
6. I read somewhere that when you mention the word aggregate during event storming, domain experts
will probably fall a sleep. Be very careful with the discussion on aggregates dragging on. You can
even consider leaving aggregates for the last session and have it with only engineers.
7. Engage silent participants. Usually the loudest people will drive the conversation. It can often
happen that the loudest ones are not the ones that have most knowledge. Engage silent participants by
asking "What do you think?".
8. Exploring an unknown domain model is a rough road. There will for sure be moments when group will
become stuck. It is your job to unblock progress by adding a big question mark, noting the ambiguity
and moving on.
9. After few sessions the value and knowledge that people will get out of sessions will diminish. Be
mindful of this and know when to stop. Sometimes a quick feedback survey after the session can help
with determining if participants are willing to keep event storming.
10. And finally have fun! Event storming should not be a super serious and formal session. Elicit 
informal behaviour by doing an icebreaker at the start of the sessions and keeping the tone light.

And that's it!  
Now you should be ready to facilitate your own event storming sessions.
