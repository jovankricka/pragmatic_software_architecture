# Hexagonal Architecture Introduction

Hey again everyone!
Following section will take us on a journey through Hexagonal Architecture.
A pattern that flips how we structure our applications for better adaptability and maintainability.

We will uncover the core principles that make Hexagonal Architecture stand out from traditional methods.
And we will deep dive into this modular and scalable design pattern.

In this section we will cover the following topics:

* layered architecture,
* core concepts of hexagonal architecture,
* coding the hexagon,
* separation of concerns in the hexagon,
* modular monolith and
* multiverse of hexagons.

So without further ado let's get to it!
