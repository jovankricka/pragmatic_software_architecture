# Hexagonal Architecture Introduction

Hey again everyone!
Following section will take us on a journey through Hexagonal Architecture.
This pattern that flips how we structure our applications for better adaptability and maintenance.

We will uncover the core principles that make Hexagonal Architecture stand out from traditional methods.
And we will deep dive into this modular and scalable design pattern.

In this section we will cover the following topics.

* We will start by reflecting on well known layered architecture.
* After that we will introduce core concepts of hexagonal architecture and
* we will code our first hexagon.
* Then we will talk a bit more about separation of concerns in the hexagon and
* follow up with some advanced topics such as modular monolith and
* multiverse of hexagons.

So without further ado let's get to it!
