Congratulations on reaching the final lecture of this section!  


In this summary lecture, we'll recap the key concepts and insights we've covered throughout the event storming section.


We started with an introduction to event storming and its significance in software modeling.  


We explored the event storming format, to show what are the goals and expected outcome of this workshop.


We delved deeper into the roles of actors, commands, and events, understanding how they shape the system's behavior.  


* Actors represent the entities or systems interacting with the software,
* commands capture the intentions or requests made by actors and
* events represent state changes or significant occurrences within the system.


We also discussed additional concepts such as views, policies, aggregates, and external systems.


* Views allow actors to perceive and interact with the system,
* policies define the rules and constraints governing the system
* aggregates group together related entities and
* external systems represent dependencies or integrations.


And lastly, we went through the ten facilitation tips to ensure successful event storming sessions.


By applying these concepts, techniques, and facilitation tips, you'll be well-equipped to conduct
event storming sessions and create software architectures that align with the needs of stakeholders and the domain.


Congratulations on completing this section!  


In the next section, we'll dive into a more hands-on topic of Hexagonal architecture!
